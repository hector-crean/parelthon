[00:00:05] Atopic dermatitis 
[00:00:06] or ad 
[00:00:07] is the most common 
[00:00:08] form of eczema 
[00:00:09] characterized by 
[00:00:10] dry, 
[00:00:11] itchy, inflamed 
[00:00:12] skin and 
[00:00:13] rash. 
[00:00:14] Eczema is a chronic 
[00:00:15] skin condition 
[00:00:16] caused in part 
[00:00:17] by an overactive 
[00:00:18] immune system, 
[00:00:19] which causes chronic 
[00:00:20] systemic 
[00:00:21] inflammation inside the 
[00:00:22] body. This 
[00:00:23] inflammation 
[00:00:24] can lead to 
[00:00:25] itchiness, rashes, and 
[00:00:26] lesions on the 
[00:00:27] skin surface, 
[00:00:28] which vary in 
[00:00:29] appearance across 
[00:00:30] different skin tones and 
[00:00:31] parts of the body.
[00:00:32] 
[00:00:32] 
[00:00:33] When eczema 
[00:00:34] symptoms are not 
[00:00:35] visible, there is still 
[00:00:36] ongoing or 
[00:00:37] chronic 
[00:00:38] inflammation underneath the 
[00:00:39] skin's 
[00:00:40] surface. 
[00:00:41] In addition to 
[00:00:42] chronic inflammation, 
[00:00:43] a weakened skin 
[00:00:44] barrier, 
[00:00:45] genetic factors, 
[00:00:46] and environmental 
[00:00:47] exposures may 
[00:00:48] also contribute 
[00:00:49] to eczema signs 
[00:00:50] and symptoms. 
[00:00:51] Let's take a deeper 
[00:00:52] look. As 
[00:00:53] part of the body's 
[00:00:54] natural defense 
[00:00:55] system, immune 
[00:00:56] cells protect us from 
[00:00:57] harmful foreign 
[00:00:58] substances 
[00:00:59] like bacteria, 
[00:01:00] viruses, 
[00:01:01] allergens, and 
[00:01:02] irritants.
[00:01:03] Typically, 
[00:01:04] immune cells are not 
[00:01:05] very active under the 
[00:01:06] skin, but in 
[00:01:07] people with 
[00:01:08] eczema, they become 
[00:01:09] overactive. 
[00:01:10] These 
[00:01:11] overactive immune 
[00:01:12] cells release 
[00:01:13] cytokines, 
[00:01:14] small chemical 
[00:01:15] messengers that communicate 
[00:01:16] inflammatory 
[00:01:17] signals to other 
[00:01:18] immune cells. 
[00:01:19] There are many 
[00:01:20] types of 
[00:01:21] cytokines, but in 
[00:01:22] eczema, 
[00:01:23] interleukin 4, IL 
[00:01:24] 4, and 
[00:01:25] 
[00:01:26] interleukin 
[00:01:27] 13, IL 13, in 
[00:01:28] particular, 
[00:01:29] can become 
[00:01:30] overactive, sending 
[00:01:31] too many 
[00:01:32] inflammatory signals 
[00:01:33] under the skin, 
[00:01:34] leading 
[00:01:35] to a chronic 
[00:01:36] cycle of 
[00:01:37] inflammation under the 
[00:01:38] skin, that 
[00:01:39] causes eczema signs 
[00:01:40] and symptoms, 
[00:01:41] like intense 
[00:01:42] itch and 
[00:01:43] rashes.
[00:01:43] The 
[00:01:44] skin cell's protective 
[00:01:45] barrier is like 
[00:01:46] a brick wall, 
[00:01:47] where skin cells 
[00:01:48] act as the bricks 
[00:01:49] and lipids 
[00:01:50] serve as the mortar. 
[00:01:51] The mortar 
[00:01:52] holds the bricks 
[00:01:53] together, 
[00:01:54] creating a protective 
[00:01:55] barrier that prevents 
[00:01:56] the entrance of 
[00:01:57] harmful pathogens. 
[00:01:58] In eczema, 
[00:01:59] Constant 
[00:02:00] inflammation and 
[00:02:01] cytokine 
[00:02:02] signaling diminishes the 
[00:02:03] production of an 
[00:02:04] important protein 
[00:02:05] in these bricks 
[00:02:06] called filigrene, 
[00:02:07] and causes the 
[00:02:08] formation of 
[00:02:09] itchy rashes on the 
[00:02:10] skin.
[00:02:11] This weakens the 
[00:02:12] protective barrier, and 
[00:02:13] making it more 
[00:02:14] susceptible to 
[00:02:15] damage. This 
[00:02:16] results in 
[00:02:17] further breakdown of the 
[00:02:18] protective barrier, 
[00:02:19] allowing 
[00:02:20] foreign 
[00:02:21] substances such as 
[00:02:22] germs, irritants and 
[00:02:23] allergens to enter 
[00:02:24] the body. 
[00:02:25] And, increasing 
[00:02:26] the activity of 
[00:02:27] immune cells, 
[00:02:28] contributing to more 
[00:02:29] inflammation, 
[00:02:30] itch and rash 
[00:02:31] on the skin 
[00:02:32] surface.
[00:02:32] If the 
[00:02:33] underlying 
[00:02:34] cause of 
[00:02:35] inflammation is left 
[00:02:36] untreated, the 
[00:02:37] cycle of 
[00:02:38] inflammation leading to 
[00:02:39] itching, scratching, 
[00:02:40] skin barrier 
[00:02:41] breakdown and entrance 
[00:02:42] of harmful 
[00:02:43] stimuli can 
[00:02:44] continue in a vicious 
[00:02:45] loop, causing 
[00:02:46] signs and symptoms 
[00:02:47] to worsen over 
[00:02:48] time. 
[00:02:49] So, how can 
[00:02:50] it be controlled? 
[00:02:52] Dupixent is a 
[00:02:53] biologic treatment 
[00:02:54] for adults and 
[00:02:55] children 6 months of 
[00:02:56] age and older 
[00:02:57] with moderate to 
[00:02:58] severe eczema.[00:02:59] 
[00:02:59] To be 
[00:03:00] effective, dupixent is 
[00:03:01] injected under 
[00:03:02] the skin, or 
[00:03:03] 
[00:03:04] subcutaneously. Once it 
[00:03:05] enters the body, 
[00:03:06] it binds to a 
[00:03:07] specific receptor, 
[00:03:08] IL 
[00:03:09] 4R 
[00:03:10] alpha, on the 
[00:03:11] surface of certain 
[00:03:12] immune cells, and 
[00:03:13] blocks IL 
[00:03:14] 4 and IL 
[00:03:15] 13 from 
[00:03:16] sending 
[00:03:17] inflammatory signals to 
[00:03:18] other immune cells. 
[00:03:19] helping to 
[00:03:20] reduce 
[00:03:21] inflammation. By 
[00:03:22] stopping the signal, 
[00:03:23] Dupixent helps reduce 
[00:03:24] 
[00:03:25] overactivity of these 
[00:03:26] immune cells 
[00:03:27] under the skin, which 
[00:03:28] improves eczema 
[00:03:29] signs and 
[00:03:30] symptoms on the surface, 
[00:03:31] resulting in 
[00:03:32] noticeably 
[00:03:33] clearer skin and 
[00:03:34] less itch.
[00:03:35] 
[00:03:36] Dupixent also 
[00:03:37] helps build back 
[00:03:38] and improve the 
[00:03:39] skin's natural 
[00:03:40] protective barrier 
[00:03:41] against harmful 
[00:03:42] irritants by 
[00:03:43] normalizing the 
[00:03:44] production of 
[00:03:45] filigree. 
[00:03:46] By targeting an 
[00:03:47] underlying source of 
[00:03:48] inflammation 
[00:03:49] inside the body, 
[00:03:50] contributing to 
[00:03:51] eczema, 
[00:03:52] dupixent can 
[00:03:53] help heal the skin 
[00:03:54] from within.
